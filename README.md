Clement Moissard has a version of LatHyS that simulates transient events impacting Earth's geomagnetic environment. See https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1330397/full

Sae Aizawa has a version of LaThyS that simulates the Venusian geomagnetic environment in steady state. See https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003206332200085X

In this project, we want to add Clement's transient events to Sae's Venusian environment.
